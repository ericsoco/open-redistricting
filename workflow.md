# Open Redistricting Workflow

## Setup

### 1. Set up a GitHub account.

If you already have a GitHub account you'd like to use for sharing your district maps, use that account and skip this step. Otherwise, you can create a new GitHub account, following these steps.

1. Ensure you have a valid email account that has not yet been used to set up a GitHub account.
2. Visit [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and create a new account.
3. Choose a free account -- we're working in the open here, and GitHub requires you to pay only for private repositories.
4. After verifying your email address, you can start a new project; this takes us to Step 2 below.

### 2. Initialize a git repository for your project.

// TODO: GitHub desktop client (advanced users can use command line / GitHub website)

### 3. Create (and validate) your geojson file(s).

Create your district map with the tool of your choice, and export it as a `.geojson` file.

If you've made any changes by hand, you might want to validate the `.geojson` file with a tool like [MapBox's GeoJSON Hint](https://www.mapbox.com/geojsonhint/) or [GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/).

### 4. Commit your geojson file(s).
